# About This Project

A smart room automation system that can automatically turn off the light when there is no occupancy detection for a period of time without using any camera with the main goal of reducing electricity consumption and keeping customer privacy.


# Key Achievements

-   Collected the data of 7 unique sensors and stored them in Google BigQuery database using Python libraries.
-   Built an occupancy detection machine learning model with k-nearest neighbors classification to detect the presence of humans in a room using the data from sensors.
-   Built an automation system using Python along with Google Home & Google Assistant to automatically turn off the light & A/C when there is no occupancy detection within 5 minutes.
-   Built and deployed an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to visualize both real-time and historical data of each sensor, queried from Google BigQuery database.
